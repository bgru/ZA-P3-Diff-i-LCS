Dynamic programming is used in the lcs algorithm to efficiently compute the longest common subsequence of two strings.
The main idea behind dynamic programming is to break the problem into smaller overlapping subproblems and use their solutions
to build up the solution for the larger problem.
It uses a technique called memoization to store intermediate results, which helps to avoid redundant computation of the same subproblems.

In the given lcs algorithm, a two-dimensional matrix `dp` is used to store the solutions of subproblems.
The dimensions of the matrix are `(m + 1)` and `(n + 1)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the input strings a and b, respectively.
The value of `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of the prefixes `a[0...I-1]` and `b[0...J-1]`.

The algorithm fills the `dp` matrix iteratively using two nested loops.
The time complexity of this part is o(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of strings a and b.
The inner loop checks if the current characters of the two strings are the same.
If they are, it sets `dp[i][j]` to the value of `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`.
Otherwise, it sets `dp[i][j]` to the maximum of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`.

After filling the `dp` matrix, the algorithm reconstructs the longest common subsequence by traversing the matrix in reverse order,
starting from the bottom-right corner (dp[m][n]) and moving towards the top-left corner (dp[0][0]).
The time complexity of this part is o(m + n).

The overall time complexity of the given lcs algorithm is o(m * n), which is a quadratic complexity.
This is because the most time-consuming part of the algorithm is filling the `dp` matrix with two nested loops
iterating over the lengths of the input strings.

The memory complexity of the given lcs algorithm is also o(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings a and b.

The primary source of memory consumption in this algorithm is the two-dimensional matrix `dp` with dimensions (m + 1) and (n + 1).
This matrix stores the length of the longest common subsequence for all possible combinations of prefixes of a and b.

Since there are (m + 1) rows and (n + 1) columns in the matrix, the total number of elements in the matrix is (m + 1) * (n + 1).
Hence, the memory complexity of the algorithm is o(m * n).

Additionally, there is a string `lcs` used to store the resulting longest common subsequence.
In the worst case, the length of the `lcs` string could be min(m, n).
However, this does not affect the overall memory complexity, as the dominant factor remains the `dp` matrix with o(m * n) complexity.

The time complexity of LCS length part is o(m * n).
The time complexity of LCS word part is o(m + n).
The overall time complexity of the LCS algorithm is o(m * n)
The memory complexity of the algorithm is o(m * n).
